Here are some fun gardening-themed OLED game ideas for your ESP32 setup:

## **Plant Growing Games**
**Flower Power** - Plant seeds and watch them grow in real-time. Use buttons to water, add fertilizer, or remove weeds. Different button combinations create different flower types. The challenge is keeping multiple plants healthy simultaneously.

**Greenhouse Manager** - Manage temperature, humidity, and light for different plants. Use UP/DOWN to adjust settings and ENTER to switch between plants. Each plant type has optimal conditions and growth stages.

## **Action Games**
**Weed Whacker** - Weeds pop up randomly across the garden. Move your cursor with UP/DOWN and press ENTER to remove them before they spread and take over your crops.

**Pest Control** - Similar to your butterfly game but reversed - use a spray bottle to eliminate aphids, slugs, and other garden pests before they damage your plants.

**Bee Pollination** - Control a bee flying between flowers. Navigate through obstacles like spider webs and rain drops while collecting pollen and pollinating flowers.

## **Puzzle/Strategy Games**
**Garden Planner** - Tetris-style game where you arrange different shaped garden plots. Each plant has specific spacing requirements and some help or hinder neighboring plants.

**Water Maze** - Route water from a source to thirsty plants by rotating pipe pieces. Increasingly complex layouts with multiple plants needing different amounts of water.

**Crop Rotation** - Plan seasonal plantings on a grid. Different crops deplete/restore soil nutrients, and you must balance harvests while maintaining soil health.

## **Collection/Management Games**
**Seed Collector** - Catch falling seeds of different types. Some are rare and worth more points. Build collections and unlock new plant varieties.

**Harvest Time** - Crops ripen at different rates. Harvest them at the perfect moment for maximum points, but wait too long and they spoil.

**Compost Sorter** - Sort falling items into compost bins, recycling, or trash. Educational and fun way to learn about sustainable gardening practices.

## **Simple Arcade Style**
**Rain Catcher** - Move watering cans to catch raindrops for your plants. Different sized drops fill cans at different rates.

**Leaf Rake** - Rake falling autumn leaves into piles. Miss too many and they cover your lawn/garden beds.

Which type appeals to you most? I can create the full code for any of these games using your same button setup and display!
