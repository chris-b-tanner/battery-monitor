I have an ESP32 and 2.42" OLED 128x64, using platformIO. 
There are 3 buttons, active low, with pull-ups on IO 26,27,34:
* UP - 26
* DOWN - 27
* ENTER - 34
I would like to make a gardening-related game where:
* on the left is a net which can be moved up and down using the up/down buttons
* butterflies approach from the right, and need to be caught with the net.
* each catch adds a point
* each miss loses a life
* there are 3 lives. 
* once all lives are lost, the game is over
Can you provide a single file with the code which I can copy/paste? 
Don't forget the function declarations needed for Platformio.
I already have the lib_dep olikraus/U8g2 installed.
